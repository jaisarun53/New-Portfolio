## 📋 Setup Steps (One-Time, 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Note:** Give it a name like "Blog Auto-Publish"
3. **Expiration:** Choose 90 days or "No expiration"
4. **Permissions:** Check ✅ **`repo`** (this allows writing to your repository)
5. **Click:** "Generate token" (green button at bottom)
6. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (it starts with `ghp_`)
   - You won't see it again!
   - It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Step 2: Add Token to Admin Panel

2. **Go to Settings** (click in sidebar)
3. **Find "GitHub Auto-Publish" section**
4. **Paste your token** in the input field
5. **Click "Save Token"**
6. You should see: ✅ **Token configured - Auto-publish enabled**

### Step 3: Test It!

1. **Go to "New Post"**
2. **Write a test post**
3. **Click "Save Post"**
4. **You should see:** "✅ Post saved and published successfully!"
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes**
6. **Check your website:** Your post should be live! 🎉

## ✨ How It Works

- **Before Setup:** Save → Download → Upload → Wait → Live
- **After Setup:** Save → Live! (automatic)

## 🔒 Security

- Token is encrypted and stored in your browser only
- Only you can see it
- Token only has access to your repository
- You can remove it anytime from Settings

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Auto-publish failed" Error?
- Check if token has `repo` permission
- Verify token hasn't expired
- Try creating a new token

### Token Not Working?
1. Go to Settings
2. Remove old token
3. Create new token (follow Step 1)
4. Add new token
5. Try again

### Still Not Working?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify repository name is correct: `jaisarun53/New-Portfolio`
- Make sure repository is accessible

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Token Expiration:** Set to "No expiration" to avoid re-setting
- **Multiple Devices:** Token is stored per browser (set it up on each device you use)
- **Backup:** Keep your token safe (but you can always create a new one)
